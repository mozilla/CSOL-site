Youth learn new skills including workforce readiness and job retention skills, handling of data, how research is done, scientific methods, use of technology for research purposes, STEM-related (science, technology, engineering, math) skills, public speaking skills, and college readiness, while exercising outside by walking their neighborhoods.

Students will also learn to objectively analyze their work & their fellow students' work, based upon the technical & visual elements of photography, art & design, by participating in one-on-one and group critiques. In the Summer Term a combination of shooting/photographic and graphic design assignments will be given, depending upon which assignments were not covered in the Fall and Spring Terms. Since there is a total of six different shooting and six different graphic design assignments given from the previous two terms, and since the average number of assignments given and completed per term is two, students will have many new and different assignments to chose from. In addition, repeat/advanced students, whom have been with the program for several years and whom have done all of the offered assignments, may chose which shooting and/or graphic design assignments they wish to work on, may add to and/or alter those assignments, and/or may create their own new assignments, as long as the final product is aesthetically pleasing. In the Fall Term students will be introduced to the use of the digital camera and photographing with it. Students will learn, while shooting landscapes/cityscapes, portraits, objects/still-lifes, and action/sports activities, basic digital camera operation, exposure and image capture techniques. In addition, they will learn the basic technical and visual aesthetics of photography and art - (exposure, the lens/depth of field, the shutter/motion, lighting, texture, pattern, negative-and-positive space and extr",

By participating in all phases of production- i.e., watering, weeding, harvesting, pest management, post-harvest handling, making compost, scientific principles, data collection, packaging, marketing, sales and food preparation teens explore the science behind farming and the skills required to develop sustainable food systems. In addition to daily farm work, students take part in nutrition, hunger, cooking, food justice and food politics activities as a means to cultivate good stewardship of community environments, provide a bridge to understanding the global and local implications of healthy food systems, and envision alternatives that offer the possibility for change. The program aims to serve as both a job training experience and to encourage leadership development. Working towards this objective, teens develop value-added products from the bounty of their hard work for a final project. Past value-added products include: bees wax lip balm, bees wax candles, specialty tea blends, dried herbs and seasonings. In addition to value-added production, participants learn the basics of bike maintenance, linking food and fitness, and will launch a new youth-run business delivering fresh produce by bike to community residents. Teens will also participate in community outreach activities to market their final product and connect with their community members about the importance of sustainable food system development.",

Students prepare wood veneers, apply glue to 7 layers of Hard Canadian Maple, insert into the vacuum bag and use a hand pump to evacuate the air out of the bag. Atmospheric pressure quickly bends the veneers into a 3-dimensional shape over the one-sided foam mold. When the glue is dry, the skateboard decks are removed from the bags, separated from the molds, the surfaces finished and the decks are ready for painting! Students work in groups to conceptualize a series of skateboard graphics in a team building environment. Participants share in the experience of constructing and designing a product of their desire infused with discussions of manufacturing methods. The apprentices create functional artwork in the form of professional quality skateboard decks.",

Teens practice warm-ups and exercises prepping them to improvise successfully. The goal of the program is for teens to learn how to communicate positively and create a product spontaneously in a group setting by listening and trusting their fellow performers. In order to achieve this, teens must rely on their ability to communicate, trust, be vulnerable, support others' ideas, be creative, vocalize, emote, be physical, and be imaginative. The teens use the skills they learn over the ten weeks to create a final show at the end of the term.

The vocal workshops taught the teens breathing techniques to maximize the sound available on a single breath as well as correct posture and 3-part harmony. The acting portion of the program emphasized the need to work as an ensemble cast, voice projection, emoting, and stage presence. With these basics firmly under their belt, the teens performed a Hip-Hop Opera that included original lyrics written by the teens. Throughout the process of developing the opera, apprentices suggested music to be included in the play, contributed poetry, and choreographed short dance numbers. One of the most rewarding aspects of this program is that it allowed teens who were otherwise not inclined to perform in front of an audience to develop the skills and confidence to do so comfortably.",

Tennis is an unique sport in that, if taught correctly, results in a high level of fitness. It develops many skills including social, physical, mental, communication, and goal setting. Tennis is enjoyable to play and learn, it does not require a high level of physical skills to start, and students can plan their own individual level of sucess.

The program aims to serve as both a job training experience and to encourage leadership development. Working towards this objective, teens develop value-added products from the bounty of their hard work for a final project. Past value-added products include: bees wax lip balm, bees wax candles, specialty tea blends, dried herbs and seasonings. In addition to value-added production, participants learn the basics of bike maintenance, linking food and fitness, and will launch a new youth-run business delivering fresh produce by bike to community residents.

This incubator teaches a broad skill set that, combined with basic business principles, will form the foundation of helping students become successful entrepreneurs and create and implement their own business concepts. Big Biz engages students through building a working knowledge of marketing, budgeting, sales, record keeping, projecting, client engagement, and some legal understanding. Our young entrepreneurs create resumes and email accounts. They also learn to create reports and spreadsheets for a business, such as cost analysis, a marketing plan, and financial records using current technology including Google Apps and MS Office for their work experience. By engaging in workshops on these subjects, followed by hands-on work at YMEN and exposure to job sites in our network, they learn to understand how the business world works, and how they may fit into that world. Finally, students in Big Biz work on the local level to understand the problems facing businesses in low-income areas and how market-driven solutions can be created through business ownership strategies.",

At the same time, teens dig deep to explore issues affecting their communities as they work toward creating a live performance and create 21-30 minutes of episodic media addressing social issues through subversion of selected genres. Final products may re-appropriate or parody telenovelas or commercials, music videos or public service announcements, etc. allowing teens to confront issues ranging from the American Dream and immigration to gang violence and generational difference. Teens work with a roster of emergent and established filmmakers in latter half of the program to create their media pieces. Film making becomes grass-roots art-making with an improvisational touch and teens are encouraged to make use of community, incidental, and found resources. The form of the final media products is informed by content which is arrived at through rigorous individual reflection and medicine circle discussions, social inquiry, and community interviews.

With a focus on character education, apprentices will receive basic training in voice, stage presence, recording and industry techniques, as well as be mentors for young people.

The material will be created with the intention that it could be used to teach younger children the value of good character. Students will also learn how to \"break down\" that matrial for teaching purposes. Students will create and record their own original piece(s)in the form of a retail Ready CD for presentation to their peers and community.

MAPSCorps staff, composed of university researchers and college students, train local youth to walk each block in South Side neighborhoods, identifying and recording the public facing businesses, organizations, and government entities offered in each non-residential building. These high-quality asset data are used by community residents, community organizations, researchers, and policymakers to design programs that improve health and foster community vitality. Youth learn new skills including workforce readiness and job retention skills, handling of data, how research is done, scientific methods, use of technology for research purposes, STEM-related (science, technology, engineering, math) skills, public speaking skills, and college readiness, while exercising outside by walking their neighborhoods. Since its 2009 inception, MAPSCorps has provided over 150 meaningful work opportunities for youth and identified over 8,300 assets in 20 of Chicagos South Side communities.",

By participating in all phases of production- i.e., watering, weeding, harvesting, pest management, post-harvest handling, making compost, scientific principles, data collection, packaging, marketing, sales and food preparation teens explore the science behind farming and the skills required to develop sustainable food systems. In addition to daily farm work, students take part in nutrition, hunger, cooking, food justice and food politics activities as a means to cultivate good stewardship of community environments, provide a bridge to understanding the global and local implications of healthy food systems, and envision alternatives that offer the possibility for change. The program aims to serve as both a job training experience and to encourage leadership development. Working towards this objective, teens develop value-added products from the bounty of their hard work for a final project. Past value-added products include: bees wax lip balm, bees wax candles, specialty tea blends, dried herbs and seasonings. In addition to value-added production, participants learn the basics of bike maintenance, linking food and fitness, and will launch a new youth-run business delivering fresh produce by bike to community residents. Teens will also participate in community outreach activities to market their final product and connect with their community members about the importance of sustainable food system development.",
