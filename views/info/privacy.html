        This privacy policy applies to the Chicago Summer of Learning website (&ldquo;CSOL Website&rdquo;) operated by the City of Chicago (&ldquo;City&rdquo;).
    </small>
</h3>
<h4>Website Visitors</h4>
<p>The City will collect, maintain and share with Sister Agencies and others as set forth below, the following categories of information from CSOL Website users: (i) the number and type of badges issued and claimed overall; (ii) the number and type of badges issued and claimed in each science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (&ldquo;STEAM&rdquo;) category, (iii) a breakdown of badges by &ldquo;issuer&rdquo; (e.g. Museum of Science &amp; Industry, Ravenswood Park, etc.); (iv) individual participant data, the participant&rsquo;s CPS student ID number, and/or certain unique identifying information including the participant&rsquo;s zip code, gender, age, grade, race/ethnicity, school, badges earned, badges claimed, and badges pledged. Like most website operators, City does collect non-personally identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, operating system, language preference, referring site and date and time of each visitor request. City also collects potentially-personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, which are non-personally identifying in and of themselves but could be used in conjunction with other information to personally identify users.</p>
<p>City&rsquo;s purpose in collecting this information is for research purposes, and the City may share such information with the following sister agencies: Chicago Public Schools, Chicago Park District, and the Chicago Public Library (&ldquo;Sister Agencies&rdquo;) and research partners. To that end, City may share potentially-personally identifying information with its employees, contractors, service providers, and subsidiaries and related organizations. Additionally, as a governmental entity, the City may be required to disclose information pursuant to the Illinois Freedom of Information Act. Otherwise, City will not publicly release potentially-personally identifying information except as set forth below.</p>
<h4>Children</h4>
<p>CSOL Website is specifically directed to individuals including children under the age of thirteen (13), and we require that such individuals provide verifiable parental consent before using the CSOL Website.</p>
<h4>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>Where City has collected personally identifying information, it discloses that information only to those of its employees, contractors, service providers, Sister Agencies and research partners that need to know that information in order to process it on City&rsquo;s behalf and that have agreed not to disclose it to others. By using Cityâ€™s websites, you consent to the transfer of your information to them. We will retain any personally identifying information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy. City does not rent or sell personally identifying information to anyone.</p>
<h4>Security</h4>
<p>City undertakes a range of security measures including physical access restraints, technical security monitoring, and internal security reviews of the environment to help to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We also have policies in place to prohibit employees from viewing personal information without business justification.</p>
<h4>Updating of Personally-Identifying Information</h4>
<p>You may request access, correction, or deletion of your personally identifiable information or potentially personally identifiable information, as permitted by law. City will seek to comply with such requests, provided that we have sufficient information to identify the personally identifiable information or potentially personally identifiable information related to you. To do so, users should look for links or contact information available on the CSOL Website or contact City by using one of the email addresses listed below.</p>
<h4>Cookies and Clear GIFs</h4>
<p><strong>What Are Cookies?</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor&rsquo;s computer, and that the visitor&rsquo;s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Most major websites use cookies. Because the browser provides this cookie information to the website at each visit, cookies serve as a sort of label that allows a website to &ldquo;recognize&rdquo; a browser when it returns to the site. The domain name in City cookies will clearly identify their affiliation with City and, where applicable, its third-party service provider.</p>
<p>Most browsers accept cookies automatically, but they can be configured not to accept them or to indicate when a cookie is being set (see <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/">http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/</a>).</p>
<p><strong>What Are Clear GIFs?</strong> Clear gifs (also known as web beacons) are used in combination with cookies to help website operators understand how visitors interact with their websites. A clear gif is typically a transparent graphic image (usually 1 pixel x 1 pixel) that is placed on a site. The use of a clear gif allows the site to measure the actions of the visitor opening the page that contains the clear gif. It makes it easier to follow and record the activities of a recognized browser, such as the path of pages visited at a website.</p>
<p><strong>How We Use Cookies and Clear GIFs.</strong>City&rsquo;s websites use cookies to help City identify and track visitors, their usage of City websites, and their website access preferences across multiple requests and visits to City&rsquo;s websites. Our websites also may use clear gifs for these purposes.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to gather aggregate data about how people use the City websites. The term usually used to describe this is &ldquo;web analytics&rdquo; and the cookies and clear gifs are the tools by which a website owner collects this web analytics data.</p>
<p>City will use the web analytics data only to determine aggregate usage patterns for our websites as described above. City websites do this by using either our own internal analytics software or by sending this information to a third-party service provider to help City analyze this data. City has agreements with its third-party service providers that they will not share this information with others or use the information for purposes other than to maintain the services they provide to City. It is possible to link cookies and clear gifs to personally identifying information, thereby permitting website operators, including our third-party analytics providers, to track the online movements of particular individuals. City does not do so and its third-party service providers are not allowed to correlate City data with any other data.</p>
<p>City uses the information provided by cookies and clear gifs to develop a better understanding of how City&rsquo;s visitors use City&rsquo;s websites, and to facilitate those visitors&rsquo; interactions with City&rsquo;s websites. City may make the aggregate data obtained from web analytics (including from our third-party analytics providers, if applicable) publicly available. If this data is made available, none of the information will be personally identifying information or potentially-personally identifying information.</p>
<p><strong>Other Third Party Cookies.</strong> Content from other sources that is hosted on City websites may sometimes contain cookies that send information to those third parties. In certain cases, often associated with embedded content such as YouTube videos and other site linking buttons, a third party cookie may be set by the 3rd party content or provider. In these cases, the privacy policy of the 3rd party gove rns with respect to information that may be collected by and sent to the respective 3rd party. If you are concerned about these third party cookies, please see the information below on how to decline cookies.</p>
<p><strong>How to Control the Use of Cookies.</strong> You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. City visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers by City, its contractors, or third-party service providers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before linking to City&rsquo;s websites. Certain features of City&rsquo;s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
<h4>What Happens if I Don&#x27;t Want to Provide my Personal Information?</h4>
<p>If you do not want to submit personal information that is necessary to provide the service or to fulfill your request, you will not be able to access and/or participate in certain activities. For example, you will not be able to register on this website or earn badges. In addition, your refusal to submit personal information may limit our ability to respond to your customer support inquiry in a timely fashion.</p>
<h4>Opt-out Procedures</h4>
<p>If you signed up to receive but no longer wish to receive electronic marketing communications from City, you can opt-out from receiving these communications by following the &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; instructions in any such communication you receive.</p>
<h4>Legal Process and Other Disclosures</h4>
<p>Consistent with our privacy commitments, we will scrutinize third party requests for information about you for compliance with the law, including those coming from governmental agencies or civil litigants. We may access, use, preserve or disclose information about you only when we have a good faith belief that it is reasonably necessary to do so to satisfy the applicable law, regulation, legal process or lawful governmental request of any country, or to protect the rights, property or safety of City, its users or the public. We will provide notice of legal process or governmental requests unless prohibited to do so by law or the circumstances warrant otherwise.</p>
<h4>Links to Third Party Websites</h4>
<p>We may include links on this site for your use and reference, including to badge issuers&rsquo; websites. We are not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. You should be aware that the privacy policies of these sites may differ from our own.</p>
<h4>Privacy Policy Changes</h4>
<p>By using the CSOL Website, you agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy. If you do not agree to the terms and conditions of this privacy policy, please do not use the CSOL Website. City may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Any and all changes will be reflected on this page.</p>
