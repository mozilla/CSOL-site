      This summer, thousands of Chicago youth have been exploring the city through programs offered by more than 100 community organizations through the Chicago Summer of Learning. As a result, Chicago’s youth have enjoyed a variety of opportunities to improve their skills and learn new ones in sports and reading, archaeology and architecture, poetry, film-making, fashion design, and more – all while earning digital badges and leveling up to new challenges!
  </p>
  <p>
      The Chicago Summer of Learning Summer Showcase brings all these organizations under one roof to celebrate and extend the learning that has happened this summer. There are three main components to the event:
  </p>
  <ol>
      <li>A Gallery for organizations to display their participants' summer learning and projects,</li>
      <li>A Maker Party pop-up makerspace where youth can work with vinyl and laser cutters and 3-D printers to learn new skills in a hands-on way, and</li>
      <li>A Youth Talent Showcase where teams will give dance and song performances.</li>
  </ol>
   <p>
      The showcase also offers the opportunity for participants to earn more badges and win raffle prizes, including tickets to sports, movie, and theater events and iPad minis!
